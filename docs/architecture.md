# Architecture Overview

## System Design Philosophy

**Deterministic over Smart**: Every operation produces the same result given the same input. No ML randomness.

**Explicit over Implicit**: Users must approve relationships. No auto-joins.

**Explainable over Black-box**: Every result includes provenance (what data + operations were used).
